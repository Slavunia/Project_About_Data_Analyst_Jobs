Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the number of junior positions, internships, and their corresponding pay:

Global Market: 
- 3% of job postings are for junior data analysts, and 2% are internships; 
- over 99% of internships globally have NULL salary values, 
making the analysis of internship salaries unrepresentative.

Germany: 
- 6% of job postings in Germany are junior roles, and 3% are internships; 
- no internship postings in Germany had salary data, 
making salary analysis for internships non-representative.

Salary Analysis: 
- Only the analysis of junior vs non-junior salaries globally is representative.
The median salary for junior data analysts globally is $57,500, 
while non-junior roles have a higher median salary of $90,000, 
indicating a clear salary gap.
- Based on the histograms (see in README.md), 
Junior roles have a salary range mainly between $40,000 and $80,000, 
peaking around $50,000-$60,000, indicating concentration in lower salary brackets.
- Non-Junior roles span a wider range from $25,000 to over $200,000, 
with a concentration around $60,000-$120,000, 
reflecting higher and more varied salary offerings.
